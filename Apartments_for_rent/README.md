# What was done

- Conducted primary data analysis for gaps, duplicates and artifacts.
- Spared DF from emissions
- Graphs of distribution of various parameters of the apartment are built
- Carried out the correlation of the dependence of the price on the parameters
- Found a dozen record cities for ads and found the average cost per square meter
- Analyzed ads in St. Petersburg and found its center

# Result

Based on the results of the study, we can draw logical conclusions that the final price directly depends on the area, distribution, number of rooms (a special case of the area), distance from the city center and the city itself. In megacities, the price is objectively higher than in the depths. In the center of a big city, the price per square meter practically does not depend on anything.
